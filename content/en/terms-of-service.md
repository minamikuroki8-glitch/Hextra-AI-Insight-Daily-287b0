# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "this Site" or "we")! Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By simply accessing or using this Site, you're pretty much saying you're cool with and agree to these terms.

## 1. What We're All About

This Site is all about giving you awesome paid subscription content and member services! Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, community vibes, and more. Just a heads-up: some of this cool stuff is only for our subscribed users.

## 2. Your Account & Signing Up

*   **Users** need to give us a valid email and set up a password to register for an account. Easy-peasy!
*   **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account safe and for everything that happens on it. 🚫 Seriously, **don't even think about** transferring or sharing your account – that's a big no-no.
*   **This Site** has the right to hit pause on or even cancel your account if you don't play by these rules.

## 3. Paid Subscription Goodness

*   **Our subscription services** are billed monthly or yearly, and you'll see all the costs super clear on the checkout page. No hidden surprises!
*   **All payments** go through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, this Site doesn't store any of your payment info. We're not into that.
*   **Subscriptions will automatically renew** – because we know you love our stuff! But hey, if you need a break, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **Our 14-day refund policy** is here for first-timers! If you're a **first-time subscriber** and you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the bottom of these terms) and tell us what went wrong. Heads up: each user gets just one shot at a refund. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, no refunds will be issued post-payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise. 💰

## 4. Content Use & Who Owns What

*   **All original content** here is copyrighted by this Site (hubtoday). So, **no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial stuff** without our permission. Got it?
*   **Users** get a non-exclusive, non-transferable access pass, purely for your personal learning and reading adventures.
*   **For any commercial use or if you want to cite us a lot**, please just hit us up for authorization. We're usually pretty cool.

## 5. Playing Nice: User Conduct

*   **Users are totally prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on other people's rights. Let's keep it friendly! 🙅‍♀️
*   **Users are also prohibited** from using any tech tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content. That's just not cool.
*   **This Site** reserves the right to yank any inappropriate content and even **ban users** who don't follow the rules.

## 6. Service Changes & Oops Moments

*   **We** might tweak, pause, or even totally stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls sometimes!
*   **This Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if our content is temporarily unreachable due to stuff beyond our control, like an act of God, a server hiccup, or a third-party service going down. Life happens! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. The Legal Stuff (Disclaimer)

*   **Information provided by this Site is just for kicks and giggles (aka reference only)!** It's **not** professional advice for finances, law, medicine, or anything super serious. Don't make big decisions based on our blog posts, okay?
*   **This Site is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Use at your own risk, folks!

## 8. Law & Order (Jurisdiction)

*   **These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of California, USA, and we'll interpret them that way, without getting tangled up in crazy conflict-of-law principles.
*   **Any squabbles arising from or related to these Terms**? Let's try to chat it out nicely first! If we can't sort it, **you agree** to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. 🤝
