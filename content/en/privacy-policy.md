## Collecting & Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you to dish out some personally identifiable information that helps us get in touch with you or figure out who you are. This personal info could include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It's collected automatically when you use the Service. Poof! 💥

Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (think IP address, for example), browser type, browser version, the pages you hit up on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how much time you spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you're rocking our Service on a mobile device, we might automatically grab certain info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're using, your mobile device's unique ID, your mobile device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

Your browser also sends us information that we might collect when you visit our Service or access it via a mobile device.

### Tracking Tech & Cookies
Cookies and similar tracking tech? We're all about 'em! We use them to keep tabs on activity on our Service and squirrel away certain info. The tracking tech we use includes beacons, tags, and scripts, all designed to gather and track info, plus boost and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a small file dropped onto your device. You can tell your browser to give all Cookies the cold shoulder or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. Heads up, though: if you don't play nice with Cookies, you might miss out on some parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to wave goodbye to Cookies, our Service might just use 'em.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other juicy website stats (like tracking how popular a certain section is and making sure the system and server are running smoothly).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. When you're offline, Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device. Session Cookies, on the other hand, vanish the moment you slam shut your web browser. 💨

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies, and here's why:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help verify user identity and prevent sketchy use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for can't be delivered, and we only use these Cookies to, well, deliver those services to you!

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to check if users have given a thumbs-up to the use of Cookies on the Website. 👍

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're cruising around the Website, like remembering your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, saving you from having to re-enter your preferences every single time you use the Website. Sweet!

For more deets on the Cookies we use and your options regarding Cookies, hit up our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to comply with our legal obligations (like if we gotta keep your data to follow applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obliged to keep this data for longer periods.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get transferred to and stored on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where the data protection laws might be different from yours.

By consenting to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving a nod to that transfer.

The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to make sure your data is treated securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information. Safety first! 🔒

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete your Personal Data or ask us to help you delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might give you the power to delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can always log into your Account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, modify, or delete your info. You can also give us a shout to ask for access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've dished out to us.

But please note: when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis, we might need to hang onto certain info.

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might be asked to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might disclose your Personal Data, believing in good faith that such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep this in mind: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage method is ever 100% secure. While we bust our humps using commercially acceptable ways to safeguard your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. It's a wild digital world out there! 😟

## Kiddo Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. Nope, not intentionally collecting any personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please get in touch! If we find out we've accidentally scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Sites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit!

We have zero control over, and take no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just sayin'! 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll let you know via email and/or a super noticeable heads-up on our Service, and we'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You're advised to regularly check out this Privacy Policy for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
